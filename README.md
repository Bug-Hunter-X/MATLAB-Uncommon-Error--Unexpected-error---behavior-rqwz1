# MATLAB Uncommon Error: Unexpected error() behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MATLAB related to the `error()` function, specifically when used within nested functions or parallel computations.

## Bug Description
The `error()` function, when improperly used, can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. It can cause issues if it's called from a nested function and not handled appropriately in the calling function.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2. Run the file `bug.m`.
3. Observe the error message.

## Solution
The solution involves careful consideration of where and how `error()` is used. Sometimes, returning a NaN or other special value might be a more appropriate way to handle errors instead of abruptly halting the program.
